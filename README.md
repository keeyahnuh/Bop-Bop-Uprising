# Bop-Bop-Uprising
An embedded systems take on a rhythm game!

We created our own rendition of a rhythm game where a user must give particular inputs by pressing the correct buttons corresponding to the note tiles on screen. The user must time the presses with the tiles as they hit the white lines. Our must-have functionalities were to play a song of our choosing aloud, create a custom map/note sequence timed with the song, obtain user input and compare corresponding tiles pressed with the white line, and continuously keep track of score and accuracy of user input.
